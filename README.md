Sub-Station-Alpha-Script-Adjuster
=================================

 Sub Station Alpha Script Adjuster is a quick and dirty program to automatically skew a SSA subtitle script's timing to better fit the intended video file. It can also do rough conversions from SRT and JACOsub to the SSA format.  Created by Craig Lotter, January 2003
